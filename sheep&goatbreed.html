                It is considered to be a good milker with large body size. The skin of these goats is considered to be of high quality because of 
                its large size and its yielding of fine leather for manufacturing clothes, shoes, 
                and gloves. These goats are also adapted to stall feeding, thus are preferred for intensive goat farming.</li><br>

            <li><b>Boer: </b>The Boer goat was probably bred from the indigenous South African goats kept by the Namaqua, San, and Fooku tribes, with some crossing of Indian and European bloodlines being possible.
               They were selected for meat rather than milk production; due to selective breeding and improvement, the Boer goat has a fast growth rate and excellent carcass qualities, making it one of the most popular breeds of meat goat in the world.</li>
